```{r global_options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE,
tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60))
```

need to play a little with the cutoff value to get it right (so that no text gets cut out of the pdf page).

# to avoir tables cut between two pages 

\pagebreak
```{r}
# Codey codey code code
```
