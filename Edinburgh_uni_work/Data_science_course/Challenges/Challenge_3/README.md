# Challenge 3 Repository for Data Science 2021

This is the reposotiry used to store all the data, code, model outputs and report used and created for the third challenge (Data Science course at the University of Edinburgh)

This work focuses on assessing red fox abundance changes over time, using a Bayesian statistical modelling approach.

The code created for the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge3-louise-litrico/tree/master/script).
The data sets used can be accessed [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge3-louise-litrico/tree/master/data) and come from the Living Planet Index data accessible [here](http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index).
The final report including all the steps and choices for the model as well as the figures created is available to download [here](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge3-louise-litrico/tree/master/reports).
