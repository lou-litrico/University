1. What is the data source?  Do you have permission to use the data?

The data comes from the Living Planet Index (LPI 2016. Living Planet Index database. 2016. < www.livingplanetindex.org/>.), available to use for scientific analysis or research and conservation purposes. 

2. What is the aim of this study?

This study aims to understand changes in red fox populations from 1970 up to 2006, and potentially predict future population changes thanks to this information. 

3. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?

How has red fox abundance changed over time?

4. Describe the key independent and dependent variable(s).

The main independent variable is time (years) and the main dependent variable is population counts for red foxes.

5. What are the spatial and temporal structures to the data (number of sites, duration in years, etc.)?

The data has been collected every year from 1970 up to 2006 in 24 different sites ranging across 5 countries. In  addition, the area sampled are situated in terrestrial systems found 4 biomes belonging to 2 realms (Nearctic and Palearctic). The data comes from 10 different studies, each using different sampling methods, and each lasting different times (from 5 to 25 years). 

6. What is the overall sample size?

There are 354 observations of red fox populations recorded in the LPI dataset. 

7. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.

I will use a generalized mixed-effects model under a Bayesian framework to see how time influences red fox abundance. This model will also enable me to account for the effect of the structure of the data sampled.

I hypothesize that the red fox population abundance is going to increase through time.

8. Is there any other study information you would like to pre-register?
