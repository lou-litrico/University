### **Hello Editors of the BBC!**

We are a team of data journalists interested in the current situation in Afghanistan. The recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan gained the attention of the whole world and since then has been one of the main topics in news and media. When Taliban last controlled Afghanistan, between 1996 and 2001, it was known for not respecting women’s rights. Girls and women were largely excluded from schools and universities.<sup>1</sup> Not long-ago Taliban government announced tightening of the restrictions for women and already effectively banned girls from education by ordering secondary schools to open for boys only.<sup>2</sup> The lack of education seriously impacts all aspects of one’s life, including health, lifespan, career prospects, and rights, highly contributing to gender inequality.<sup>3</sup>

We believe that this is a serious issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Using data from 2015 we illustrate the position of Afghan women in education in comparison to men, using multiple indicators and demonstrate whether these educational indicators worsen according to any additional inequalities, such as wealth and ethnicity (figure 1). The results lead to a crucial question; 

**What effect will the Taliban takeover have on women, particularly their education, considering an already existing inequality, and what can be done about it?**
