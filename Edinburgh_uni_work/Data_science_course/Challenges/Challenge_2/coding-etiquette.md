# Coding and Github Etiquette:

## While coding
1) **Always** PULL before working on the shared R script
2) Code within your section and let group members know if you need to make changes in their sections to avoid code conflict
3) **Always** COMMIT, PULL, PUSH once changes have been made to the script 
5) Use relative file paths 
6) Write an introduction in the R script: title, names, date last manipulated, and contact details 
7) Organize script into a logical flow using headers
8) Create meaningful but short object names
9) Object names should use underscores and avoid special characters/spaces 
10) Inline comments should be spaced with two spaces before the hashtag
11) Use a single space before and after operators (<, >, =, <-); only use a single space after a hashtag (to comment) and a comma.
12) Keep code tidy by indenting it 
13) Add a line after using %>%

### If you encounter a code conflict (as suggested in Issue #83 in DataSciencceHub2021)
1) Save a version of your script locally (as a different file name)
2) Reset the repo to the online version by either: 
  i) Downloading the conflict file from online repo and, using it, replacing the file in your local repo (recommended)
  ii) Recloning the online repo and adding changes you have made back 


## In Github
1) Keep raw data in a separate raw data folder 
2) File paths should be short and logical
3) Avoid the use of special characters and spaces in file and folder names
4) Save any graphs in the img folder
5) Create a new issue for every unique coding error encountered
