# 4th year field trip to Oban (data analysis) 

This folder contains all the data analysis that we did for the 4th year EES Oban project. 

We looked at how invertebrates responded to road disturbance and how this effect changed at different distances from the road and on diferent road types.

Our group of 5 placed pitfall traps overnight to collect samples of invertebrate diversity along transects perpendicular to roads and paths. Our data analysis revealed that there was no significant differences between the invertebrate communities present around those two types of roads.
