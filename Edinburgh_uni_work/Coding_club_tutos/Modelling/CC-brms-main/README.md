# Bayesian modelling with brms package
## From research question to final report, unleashing the full potential of brms

This repository contains all the data needed to complete the **"Bayesian modelling using the brms package" [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/brms/)**

**Data available [here](Data)**, from the Living Planet Index (full details [here](http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index))

Tutorial information:

This tutorial is aimed at people with a prior understanding of beginner-level modelling, R coding and RStudio. It builds on two tutorials created by the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io).
Those tutorials are:
- Meta-analysis for biologists using MCMCglmm (an introduction to the MCMCglmm package) available [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/mcmcglmm/index.html)
- Generalised linear models in Stan (using the Rstanarm and brms packages to run Stan models) available [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/stan-2/)

This tutorial should teach you how to create, assess, present and troubleshoot a brm model.

Please open the tutorial in Safari if possible to be sure to view all the Figures properly (some output figures don't show up in Chrome for some reason).
