This repository contains the files necessary to complete the Coding Club Qualitative Data Analysis tutorial - you can check it out at:

`sust_behaviour.csv` contains anonymised data from an online survey of sustainable activity behaviour, where each column contains the responses to a given question in the survey.

`sust_lookup.csv` contains a lookup table which links column names in `sust_behaviour.csv` to the actual question written on the survey.

`qual_example_script.R` contains an R script detailing the code presented in the online tutorial.
